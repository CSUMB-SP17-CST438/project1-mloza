## Theme: 
sushi  
It's my favorite food  

## How searches reflect theme?:
The quotes contain the keyword sushi and the images have some presence of sushi as well.  

## Problems?:
I wasn't sure where to start. I started a few days ago (before Thursday's lecture), and it felt like being thrown into the deep end. 
There was a lot of imformation of the Twitter api and not enough. I wasn't sure how to set it up. After multiple try and errors, it started working.
However, after many frustrations, I had added an empty space in my secret key. The site started working immediately after that.
I was also very confused on how to access the config vars.
After Thursday's lecture, it all made sense. I did have to stop using Tweepy since I couldn't figure out how to randomly get one tweet from a bundle 
without making it more difficult than needed. 

## Improvements?:
Relax more. I was stressing out that I haven't done much with such little time. Seek out help instead after many attempts of Google. If I had more time 
then I would try to see why link tags weren't working in my html. It would be useful to use Bootstrap.
